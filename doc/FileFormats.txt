SHAPES.EGA
----------

This contains the bitmaps for each tile.  Each tile is 16x16 pixels,
and each byte represents two pixels.  In other words, the first 8
bytes represent the 16 pixels on the first row of the first tile.

0x80    128  tile 1
0x100   128  tile 2
...
0x7F80  128  tile 255


CHARSET.EGA
-----------

This contains the bitmaps for each character in the font.  Each
character is 8x8 pixels, and each byte represents two pixels.  In
other words, the first 4 bytes represent the 8 pixels on the first row
of the first character.

The order is the standard ASCII mapping; 'A' is character 65, 'z' is
character 122.  The lowest 32 characters have the following glyphs:
0 - Ankh
1 - Symbol for horn effect
2 - Brick wall 1
3 - Brick wall 2
4 - Updown arrow
5 - Down arrow
6 - Up arrow

.EGA files (RLE encoded)
------------------------

The following .EGA files are RLE encoded: START.EGA, KEY7.EGA,
RUNE_x.EGA (where x is between 0 and 5), STONCRCL.EGA, HONESTY.EGA,
COMPASSN.EGA, VALOR.EGA, JUSTICE.EGA, SACRIFIC.EGA, HONOR.EGA,
SPIRIT.EGA, HUMILITY.EGA, TRUTH.EGA, LOVE.EGA, and COURAGE.EGA.  Each
of these files represents a 16 color 320x200 bitmap.  Each pixel is
encoded in 4 bits, like SHAPES.EGA and CHARSET.EGA.  However, runs of
identical *bytes* (not pixels) are encoded with a special run
indicator value (0x02) followed by a one byte count and a one byte
value.  This allows a single run of up to 255 bytes (510 pixels) to be
represented as three bytes.  For example, the byte values "28 28 28
28" could be represented as "02 04 28".  If the value 0x02 needs to be
represented, it *must* be encoded in a run ("02 01 02").

.EGA files (LZW encoded)
------------------------

The remaining .EGA files are LZW encoded: ABACUS.EGA, ANIMATE.EGA,
GYPSY.EGA, INSIDE.EGA, OUTSIDE.EGA, PORTAL.EGA, TREE.EGA, WAGON.EGA,
HONCOM.EGA, SACHONOR.EGA, SPIRHUM.EGA, VALJUS.EGA, and TITLE.EGA.
Also, the file SHAPES.EGZ is a LZW compressed version of SHAPES.EGA.
Like the RLE encoded files, each of these files represents a 16 color
320x200 bitmap.  LZW encoded files only seem to be used in the
introduction sequence (title.exe); the images used by avatar.exe are
RLE encoded instead.  (Description of LZW algorithm to go here).

             the border for the map/menu

VALJUS.EGA   the cards for valor and justice
SACHONOR.EGA the cards for sacrifice and honor
SPIRHUM.EGA  the cards for spirituality and humility


WORLD.MAP
---------

This is the map of Britannia. It is 256x256 tiles in total, broken up
into 64 32x32 chunks.  The first chunk is in the top left corner, the
next just below, and so on, until the last in the bottom right corner.
Each tile is stored as a byte that maps to the tiles in SHAPES.EGA.

The "chunked" layout is an artifact of the limited memory on the
original machines that ran Ultima 4.  The whole map would take 64k,
too much for a C64 or an Apple II, so the game would keep a limited
number of 1k chunks in memory at a time.  As the player moved around,
old chunks were thrown out as new ones were swapped in.

.ULT files
----------

These contain town information.  Specifically, a 32x32 map, plus the
starting position, movement behavior, and conversation index of each
NPC.  The conversation index gives the starting position of the NPC's
dialog block in the corresponding .TLK file.  I'm not sure why some of
the data is duplicated.

.TLK files
----------

These contain conversation information.  The file has a 288 (0x120)
byte block containing his or her dialogues, plus the words that
trigger his or her responses (keywords).  Most of the fields are
variable length strings terminated by a single zero byte and the
following field starts immediately after.  The blocks are padded
with zero bytes to 288 bytes.

.CON files
----------

These files contain the 11x11 battleground maps shown when combat
starts.  It has the map itself plus starting positions for up to 16
monsters and 8 party members.

.DNG files
----------

These files contain dungeon information.  The first 512 bytes are the
8x8 maps for each of the 8 levels.  These are used for the dungeons 3D
mode.  The rest of the file is a set of 16 (64 in the case of the
ABYSS.DNG) 256 byte blocks that define the dungeon rooms.

MONSTERS.SAV
------------

Ultima 4 maintains a structure (in memory) that I've decided to call
the "monster table."
When you Journey Onward, U4 loads MONSTERS.SAV into the monster table.
When you Quit & Save, U4 writes the monster table to MONSTERS.SAV.
The purpose of the monster table fields depends on the current party
location (surface, dungeon, settlement).

Surface:
On the surface, the monster table contains information about monsters
and inanimate objects (chests, horses, ships, balloon).
A table entry is free if (previousTile[i] == 0). However, when u4dos
deletes and entry, it sets both currentTile[i] and previousTile[i] to 0.
Slots 0-7 are for monsters, while slots 8-31 are for inanimate objects.
Non-empty entries don't have to be contiguous.
Whirlpools and twisters are special cases; they must be placed in slot 0-3,
or they won't swallow ships / damage the party.
When you leave Hythloth, u4dos creates the balloon at (233 / 242).
If there is more than one inanimate object on a tile, objects closer to
the beginning of the table are drawn on top of those closer to the end.
Monsters and the party are always drawn on top of inanimate objects.
The current tile and previous tile values are used during runtime.
However, when the game is saved, the previous tile must be set to the
monster's base tile.
The current tile can be any of the monster's tiles, except for pirate
ships, where the current tile determines which direction the pirate ship
is facing.
If the previous tile is not set to the monster's base tile, it won't behave
properly in u4dos: monsters with ranged attacks won't use them in combat,
twisters and whirlpools will attack the party, and pirates will appear as
pirate ships in battle.
For transports with more than one tile (horse, ship), the previous tile
determines which direction the transport is facing, while the current tile
can be any of the transport's tiles.

0xE0    32      not used

Dungeons:
In a dungeon, the monster table contains information about the monsters
in the dungeon.
A monster stored in the monster table is *also* stored in DNGMAP.SAV.
Inanimate objects are not stored in the monster table; they are stored
*only* in DNGMAP.SAV.

0xE0    32      not used

Settlements:
In a castle/town/village, the monster table is loaded from the settlement's
.ult file, starting at offset 0x400.
It contains information about the settlement's NPC's.

OUTMONST.SAV
------------

OUTMONST.SAV is a backup of the monster table, created when you enter
a dungeon or settlement.
When you leave a dungeon or settlement, the monster table is reloaded
from OUTMONST.SAV.

Exception: when you enter Hythloth though the ladder in LB's castle,
the game does not write the current monster table to OUTMONST.SAV,
because it already did that when you entered LB's castle.


DNGMAP.SAV
----------

When you Quit & Save in a dungeon, the game saves objects (orbs,
chests) and monsters in DNGMAP.SAV.
DNGMAP.SAV contains the 8x8 maps for all 8 levels.
Every tile is encoded as a byte.
The upper nibble of a tile determines the tile type (see below).
The lower nibble encodes the monster standing on the tile, except
for tiles 0x80 0x90 0xA0 0xD0 (see below).

0x00 = nothing
0x10 = ladder up
0x20 = ladder down
0x30 = ladder up/down
0x40 = chest
0x50 = hole (ceiling)
0x60 = hole (floor)
0x70 = orb (see below)
0x80 = trap (magic winds)
0x81 = trap (falling rocks)
0x8E = trap (pit)
0x90 = fountain (no effect)
0x91 = fountain (healing)
0x92 = fountain (100 hit points damage)
0x93 = fountain (cure)
0x94 = fountain (poison and 100 hit points damage)
0xA0 = magic field (poison)
0xA1 = magic field (energy)
0xA2 = magic field (fire)
0xA3 = magic field (sleep)
0xB0 = altar (stone color depends on dungeon)
0xC0 = door
0xDn = dungeon room #n
0xE0 = illusionary wall
0xF0 = wall

Monsters:

0 = none
1 = rat
2 = bat
3 = spider
4 = ghost
5 = slime
6 = troll
7 = gremlin
8 = mimic
9 = reaper
A = insects
B = gazer
C = phantom
D = orc
E = skeleton
F = rogue

Orbs:
When a PC touches an orb, one or more attributes are raised by 5
points each.
Which attributes are raised depends on the dungeon.

TITLE.EXE
---------

This executable is launched by ultima.com to display the introduction
and create new characters.  When "journey onward" is selected from the
intro menu, it exits and ultima.com passes control off to avatar.exe,
the main game executable.  This .exe has lots of the data necessary
for the intro screens embedded in it.
